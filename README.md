- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sankaa1
- 👀 I’m interested in WebDevelopment. My major concern is about accessibility (my piano teacher was blind, and she used internet as she could...) This is not acceptable ! In 2021, everybody has to have a great access to the internet !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I learned before C++ and it's grand child PHP. But Py-dependencies give me a lot of headaches...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on updates, and/or accessibility fixes ! You've got an internet site or application and you would like to make it 21th century compatible ? Tell it to me
- 📫 How to reach me? Simple as well! alain.rudolf@ik.me
